\subsubsection{2nd. Heliocentric stage }
In this section the equations and assumptions done in order to obtain the orbital elements of the trajectory will be explained. The objective the calculations done regarding this stage is to find:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Omega$ : Right ascension of the ascending node.
\item \textit{e}: Eccentricity.
\item \textit{i}: Inclination to the ecliptic plane.
\item \textit{a}: Semimajor axis.
\item $\omega$ : Argument of the perihelion. 
\end{itemize}
