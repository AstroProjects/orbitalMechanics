		\subsection{Temperature}
		\paragraph{}In order to calculate the temperature of reference, the ICAO definition has been followed. Thus, an archive which could give the maximum temperature of each day of one entire month during a range of 4 or more years have been search. After an scrupulous research through the Internet, a database successfully meet our requirements. An Excel worksheet has been made in order to gather all the maximum temperatures and calculate the medium maximum temperature of each year. 
		
		After that, the medium maximum temperature between 2014 and 2017 have been calculated by adding each year maximum medium temperature and dividing it by 4. The final temperature of reference (\(T_{ref}\)) obtained by this method is 32,38\(\degree\)C.
